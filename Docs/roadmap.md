# DemoApp Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
DemoApp is a macOS application designed to efficiently manage email auto-replies. It allows users to connect to various email providers, set up auto-reply rules, view incoming emails, send automatic responses, and log sent auto-replies. The app is built using SwiftUI and AppKit for a seamless macOS experience.

## Features
- **Email Login**: Connect to email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and iCloud.
- **Send Auto-Reply**: Automatically send predefined responses to incoming emails.
- **View Sent Auto-Replies**: Keep a history of all sent auto-replies.
- **View Incoming Emails**: Display a list of received emails.
- **Manage Auto-Reply Rules**: Create and manage auto-reply rules based on keywords.
- **Auto-Reply Generator**: Generate responses dynamically based on email content and user preferences.

## Technologies
### Frontend
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface.
- **AppKit**: For macOS-specific functionalities and window management.

### Backend
- **Python**: Handles backend logic and processing.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for API requests.
- **SMTP/Gmail API**: Manages email sending functionality.

### Data Storage
- **UserDefaults**: Stores user session data and app settings.

### Error Handling and Monitoring
- **NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler**: Manages global error handling.
- **NSLog**: Logs errors and tracks performance.
